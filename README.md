# Employ-YAY! 

In this project, Iâ€™ve created an application that takes information about employees and generates an HTML page that would display the summary of each employee. This is generated using the command line application that will prompt the user a series of questions for information about the team manager and the team members. With this application, there is only one team manager but the user can have as many team members composed of engineers and interns. This is made for managers that would like to display and easily access the information of each of their employees' emails and profiles.

In this project, it has passed all the unit tests and utilizes Inquirer npm package to prompt the user the following information: Name, Email, ID and specific information based on their role in the company.
